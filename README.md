Project Title:Solaris

Description:
Solaris is a web application designed for educational purposes, providing users with an immersive experience in exploring information about various planets in our solar system. This project offers an interactive interface where users can click on planets to access detailed information, including facts about the planet's size, distance from the sun, temperature, and the presence of moons. The application features a visually engaging star field backdrop to enhance the overall user experience.

Features:

Clickable Planets: Users can click on individual planets to view detailed information in an overlay.
Interactive Star Field: The application includes a dynamic star field that adds a visually appealing backdrop to the planetary information.
Technologies Used:

HTML
CSS
Vanilla JavaScript
Fetch API for data retrieval
Asynchronous JavaScript (Async/Await) for handling API requests

Project Setup:
To run the project locally, you can use a code editor like Visual Studio Code and an extension such as "Live Server" for hosting. Due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions, it is essential to use a server with a valid address. "Live Server" provides a quick and convenient solution for this purpose.

How to Run Locally:

Download or clone the project repository.
Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code or your preferred code editor.
Install the "Live Server" extension if not already installed.
Right-click on the HTML file (e.g., index.html) and select "Open with Live Server."
Note on CORS:
The application fetches data from an external API to gather information about planets. Due to security restrictions, browsers enforce the Same-Origin Policy, which may block requests to a different domain. To overcome this, a server with a valid address is required, and "Live Server" serves as a convenient solution for local development.
